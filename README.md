# Transaction-manager

This is a basic app to manage transactions. The homepage is at https://transaction-manager-olive.vercel.app/. Google chrome is recommended.

Transactions are listed at https://transaction-manager-olive.vercel.app/transactions.
Each transaction can be deleted via the 'delete' button.
At the bottom of the page is the sum of the transaction amounts, and a field which allows the user to add a new transaction with their chosen title.

The 'Transaction details' link takes the user to a page displaying the mutable fields associated with the transaction. The fields are preset with the current values of these fields, and these values can be updated by typing a new value into the field and clicking 'Save'.
